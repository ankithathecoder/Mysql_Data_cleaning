Data Cleaning - Layoffs Dataset (SQL)
Project Overview
This project focuses on data cleaning for the layoffs dataset using SQL queries. The primary goal is to clean the dataset and prepare it for further analysis. Data cleaning helps identify and handle issues such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and incorrect data types, ensuring the dataset is consistent and reliable for future use.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about layoffs in various companies. The key columns in the dataset are:

Company: Name of the company.

Location: Geographical location of the layoffs.

Industry: The industry to which the company belongs.

Total Laid Off: The total number of employees laid off.

Percentage Laid Off: The percentage of employees laid off relative to the company's total workforce.

Date: The date when the layoffs occurred.

Stage: The stage or phase of the layoff.

Country: The country in which the company operates.

Funds Raised (Millions): The amount of funds raised by the company (in millions).

Objectives
The main objectives of the data cleaning process are:

Identify and handle issues: Detect missing or inconsistent data and handle them appropriately.

Prepare data for further analysis: Clean the data so that it is ready for deeper analysis, visualization, or modeling.

Standardize formats: Ensure that text columns and date columns are standardized.

Steps Performed in Data Cleaning
1. Data Inspection
Loaded the dataset and examined the first few rows to understand its structure.

Checked for NULL values, duplicates, and inconsistencies across different columns.

2. Data Cleaning Operations
Remove Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure the dataset contains unique rows.

Handle NULL/Blank Values:

Checked for NULL or blank values in critical fields such as industry and total_laid_off.

Addressed missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or removing rows with critical missing data.

Standardization:

Standardized text columns (e.g., corrected inconsistent industry names like "crypto" to "Crypto").

Ensured location and country names were consistent (e.g., removed trailing punctuation marks).

Date Format Correction:

Ensured that the date column followed the correct DATE format for consistency in further analysis.

3. Exploratory Analysis
Performed queries to summarize key variables, such as the total number of layoffs, industry, and country.

Explored patterns, such as the relationship between layoffs and different industries or countries.

4. NULL and Missing Data Handling
Focused on identifying rows with missing data and handled them either by filling in missing values or removing rows with critical NULL values that might affect the analysis.

5. Final Data Inspection
After cleaning and transforming the dataset, a final review was conducted to ensure all data issues were resolved and the dataset was ready for further analysis.

Tools and Technologies Used
SQL: Used for querying and performing data cleaning operations in the relational database.

MySQL (or any equivalent relational database management system): Used to execute SQL queries and manage the dataset.

Conclusion
By performing data cleaning on the layoffs dataset, we have ensured that it is now ready for further analysis or statistical modeling. The dataset is more consistent, and any issues related to missing, duplicated, or inconsistent data have been addressed. With cleaned data, it is now possible to extract meaningful insights and trends that can guide business decisions or further research into the impact of layoffs across industries and regions.
